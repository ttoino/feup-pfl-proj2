# FEUP-PFL-PROJ2

Second project for the PFL course unit at FEUP.

The goal of this project was to develop a board game in the terminal, including at least two levels of CPU players.
The chosen game was [Center](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/360905/center), a 2v2 game played on an odd-sided square board (traditionally 9x9), where the objective is to play your piece in the center cell, but you can only play on cells where you can see as many pieces of your color as there are cells separating it from the border.
